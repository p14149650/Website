			     <p>A final year student at De Montfort University studying BSc (Hons) Information and communication Technology 
				 seeking a graduate opportunity in both technology and the IT sector. 
				 I have excellent communication skills and have had experience of visiting different client sites, assessing their needs 
				 and demonstrating what I can offer to improve their business outlook.I have actively taken into account my studies and the roles I have been involved with, 
				 to improve my skills and abilities to adapt to the way of life. 
				 Being determined and decisive I like to use my initiative to develop effective solutions and overcome problems to challenges. 
				 Having worked as a team during projects for University has also helped me enhance my interpersonal skills 
				 and enabled me to work efficiently under pressure.</p>
